    <p>Just over a month ago, I got an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a>. An Ergodox is an <a href="https://github.com/Ergodox-io/">open source</a> split ergonomic mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1152/3264/products/IMG_5731x2_fe5172bf-ec03-4be2-ac55-9e545a128ac5.jpg?v=1492776869" alt="Ergodox EZ" /></p>

<p>While the Ergodox design is open source and not too difficult to build by yourself, I opted to get an Ergodox EZ from ZSA since with school being online I don’t have access to any of the tools required. Additionally, ZSA made keyboards are pretty well respected in terms of build quality, quality control, etc.</p>

<p>I decided to get an Ergodox for a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ergonomics
    <ul>
      <li>I type 4 hours on most days, especially since online school’s started</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Open Source
    <ul>
      <li>I strongly believe in open source as a philosophy. It’s nice to know that this keyboard is reproducible regardless of what happens to ZSA.</li>
      <li>The firmware, <a href="https://github.com/qmk">QMK</a> is extensible, pretty easy to understand/change, and super featureful. Its opensource-ness is invaluable for tweaking things and it’s just cool to know that I can always peek in at the code running my keyboard. I’ve also hand coded zome macros that weren’t possible through the ZSA oryx configurator.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Boredom
    <ul>
      <li>I kind of got bored of normal keyboards. The Ergodox is different from standard keyboards in two main ways: it’s split and orthocolumnar.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>So, was it worth the $280 price tag? I’d say yes. While the coolness factor has somewhat worn off, the ergonomics and the opensource-ness keep me very happy. Every time I try to type on a normal keyboard I’m reminded of how comfortable split layouts are. It’s like going from 30 to 60 FPS for the first time. Additionally, I’ve actually gotten faster on the new layout than I was before. I’m not sure whether or not it’s just because I started practicing more, but it’s not like I was unpracticed before at 110 WPM. The improvement is definitely greater for coding since there’s so many far away keys that I now have on homerow or near it through a different layer.</p>

<hr />

<p>Is this my endgame? No, definitely not. Let’s look at the 3 reasons I had for switching:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ergonomics
    <ul>
      <li>The Ergodox is a <strong>huge</strong> step up from a standard layout keyboard. However, I’ve also become more sensitive to ergonomic flaws. The Ergodox’s ergonomic problems are fairly well documented: the thumb cluster is pretty far, the pinky stagger is pretty light, and some other minor ones. Another problem for me is that the wristwrests don’t tent with the keyboard, so I just keep it untented. I’m planning on 3D printing something to fix that though.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Open Source
    <ul>
      <li>The only step up from something being completely open sourced is me designing and building it myself, and that’s what I plan to do.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Boredom
    <ul>
      <li>Change is fun. Endgame is boring. MCU fans might hate me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>I plan on designing and building my own keyboard next summer, and hopefully building it once I can get onto campus and use some tools. The major things I plan on changing are as I mentioned in the ergonomics section above: I’m going to improve the stagger, update the thumb cluster, and make some wristwrests that move with the tent. I’d also like to add backlighting and underglow even though I probably wouldn’t use them. I’m aware of other Ergodox incremental improvements such as the Redox and the ZSA Moonlander, but I think I can do it better (by my standards) myself. I’m actually thinking of measuring my fingers and determining the stagger based off the measurements.</p>
